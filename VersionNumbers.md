# Introduction #

LRFTools uses three numbers for a release.



# Details #

Two first are Version and Revision. Third one is the current subversion repository checkpoint. As LRFTools was first developed at home and then uploaded to googlecode, there is 137 checkpoints that googlecode is not holding.

So version v0.9.170 means:
**Version** 0
**Release** 9
**Checkpoint** 170 (or checkpoint 33 at googlecode svn repository)

How do you know if commited changes to svn repository are downloadable at 'Downloads' page? You must add 137 to the latest checkpoint (visible as r# at Project Home/Updates). If there is a download that ends whith this number, then repository and downloads are sinchronyzed.
