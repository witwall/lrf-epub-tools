# Introduction #

Sometimes LRFTools fails to convert from PDF to epub format, usually by not recognizing compression method or the ColorSpace of an Image.


# Details #

If you has access to a Windows Box you can print the PDF with Acrobat Reader to a virtual printer BullZip. This action again converts the original PDF to an exactly appaerance new PDF, but BullZip uses well known ColorSpaces and compression methods, so LRFTools can read  the new PDF.

I don't know if there is similar software (I mean BullZip) for other OSes...
